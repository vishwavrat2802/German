		            <p>The advanced education system of Germany is one of the leading systems in the European Union & the country's most attractive system for students seeking for better educational opportunity. The university fee in Germany is approximately 400-to-500 euros per semester (may vary for different institution). Germany has almost  430 universities offering 15000 specializations in various branches for students round the globe.</p>
		            <div class="text-about">
		            	<h4>Zero Tution Fee</h4>
			            <p>You may have wanted to study in Europe but you are concerned about fees and financial support. Germany may be the place for you! Studying in Germany at the university level is completely free. Yes, that's real ! Even as an international student, you do not have to pay tuition fees in Germany. All nationalities are completely exempt from tuition fees. In fact, if you finish a university level study at a German university, you can then join the graduate program for free as well. You can save tuition fees for other important things like housing, study materials, social life and finding places there.</p>
			            <h4>Quality Institutes</h4>
			            <p>Germany is a popular student destination, a non- English-speaking country where there are some highly ranked universities in Western Europe. You can see the reasons for this success when reading this article. In 2015, the University Times ranked University of Munich ranked 29th in the world, and Heidelberg ranked 37 and Humboldt in Berlin in 49th place.</p>
			            <h4>Job Opportunities / Stay Back</h4>
			            <p>After graduating from the university, international students are allowed to stay for up to 18-months in Germany to find a job, which is enough time compared to many other European countries such as UK where the government gives you only three months after graduation to look for a job.</p>
